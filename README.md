# statistics

Some scripts and functions to ~~automate~~ _learn_ things from my statistics class

DISCLAIMER: I'm dumb and this is probably all wrong

## Usage

Run the project directly to build a frequency distribution table:

    $ clj -M -m statistics.core 3.11 8.88 9.26 10.81 12.69 13.78 15.23 15.62 17.00 17.39 18.36 18.43 19.27 19.50 19.54 20.16 20.59 22.22 23.04 24.47 24.58 25.13 26.24 26.26 27.65 28.06 28.08 28.38 32.03 36.37 38.98 38.64 39.16 41.02 42.97 44.08 44.67 45.40 46.69 48.65 50.39 52.75 54.80 59.07 61.22 70.32 82.70 85.76 86.37 93.34

It should produce an `out.html` file containing something like this:

<img src="./output-example.png" />

Build an uberjar:

    $ clojure -X:uberjar

This will update the generated `pom.xml` file to keep the dependencies synchronized with
your `deps.edn` file. You can update the version information in the `pom.xml` using the
`:version` argument:

    $ clojure -X:uberjar :version '"1.2.3"'

If you don't want the `pom.xml` file in your project, you can remove it, but you will
also need to remove `:sync-pom true` from the `deps.edn` file (in the `:exec-args` for `depstar`).

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar statistics.jar
