# dataviz

Some scripts and functions to ~~automate~~ _learn_ things from my statistics class

## Usage

Run the project directly to build and frequency distribution table:

    $ clj -M:run 3.12 3.18 3.21 3.22 3.22 3.25 3.26 3.28 3.13 3.19 3.21 3.22 3.23 3.25 3.26 3.28 3.14 3.19 3.21

This will produce something like this:

<img src="./output-example.png" />

Build an uberjar:

    $ clojure -X:uberjar

This will update the generated `pom.xml` file to keep the dependencies synchronized with
your `deps.edn` file. You can update the version information in the `pom.xml` using the
`:version` argument:

    $ clojure -X:uberjar :version '"1.2.3"'

If you don't want the `pom.xml` file in your project, you can remove it, but you will
also need to remove `:sync-pom true` from the `deps.edn` file (in the `:exec-args` for `depstar`).

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar dataviz.jar
